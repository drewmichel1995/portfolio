full stack, responsive portfolio

### Stack:

  * MongoDB
  * NGINX
  * Docker, Docker Compose
  
### Prerequisites:
  * Docker, Docker Compose
  
  This portfolio was created with the intention of displaying my own personal work; however all of that data populating the portfolio is pulled from MongoDB, so anyone could update the information and images to make use of this application.
  
  To start the application, enter **docker-compose up -d** in the root directory of the project.
