Through this role, I have become confident in my ability to develop and maintain full stack containerized apps, generally utilizing a Java backend, React or Angular frontend, and an Nginx reverse proxy service. Utilizing Nginx and Docker has allowed me to streamline deployment and configuration for these applications. These applications range from reporting services to interactive tools to help our engineers visualize model based data.",

      "description": "At Averitt, I primarily acted as software developer and database administrator. Averitt primarily used IBM's iSeries for their database and server. Because of this, I gained experience with understanding uncommon operating systems and certain business tools offered by IBM. The iSeries uses DB2 as its database standard, which while a bit dated, fully supports using modern SQL, which is how I primarily manipulated the database. Most programming on the iSeries was done in RPG Free and Command Line language. I also designed, developed, and maintained several SOAP web services from a Windows 2008 server. This required learning various ways to allow these operating systems to exchange data, correctly wrap the data, and then send the data off through the Windows Task Scheduler.",
